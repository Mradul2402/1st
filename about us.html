     <h1>What is organ donation and transplantation?</h1>
     <p>Organ donation and transplantation is a surgical process to replace a failing organ with a healthy one from someone else who doesn’t need it. Organ donors are usually recently deceased people who either volunteered before their death to donate their organs afterward, or their family donated them on their behalf. Organ recipients are usually people who are critically ill in the end stages of organ failure. Organ donation and transplantation can save these people’s lives. But due to scarcity, unfortunately, not everyone who needs an organ transplant gets one in time.

Healthy people can choose to donate certain organs and tissues that they can spare while protecting their own state of health. For example, you can live with only one kidney and donate your other kidney. You can also donate a portion of your liver, and your liver will grow back to nearly full size. The piece of liver that you donate will also grow to a full functional size in the recipient. Most people who need an organ transplant have a long and uncertain wait ahead. Living donors can spare them that wait and leave the next organ available for someone else.</p>

    <h1>Why is organ donation important?</h1>
    <p>Organ transplantation is one of the great advances in modern medicine. It offers a second chance at life to people of all ages who have life-threatening diseases or injuries to their vital organs. Other donated tissues, like corneas, tendons and bones, can enhance lives by helping restore sight, movement and other physical functions. But the need for organ donations far exceeds the available supply. In the U.S., over 100,000 people are waiting for a life-saving organ transplant on any given day. But only about 40,000 transplants take place any given year.</p>
