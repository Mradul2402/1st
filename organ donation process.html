    <h1>ORGAN DONATION PROCESS SYSTEM</h1>
    <P>The organ donation process in India is under the Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act, which is categorised based on two types â€“

        Living organ donation (donation while the donor is living)
        Organ donation after death (donation of organs after the donor is dead)</P>

        <h1>Types Of Organ Donation</h1>
        <div><img class="img2" src="process.jpg" height="500px" width="700px" alt="image not found" title="Organ Donation Process" border="5px solid black"></div>
        <p>Based on the donor's live status, they are two types<br> <br> <br> 

            Living donors<br><br>
            Cadaver donors (Non-living)<br>
            </p>
            <h2> Living Donor</h2>
            <p>  These are the ones who are in relation to the recipient or the ones who donate out of affection and be a part of a noble cause with the approval of the authorisation committee. Based on the specification of tissue or organ recipients, the living donors are further divided into two types
                
                Directed donation: The donor names a specific tissue or organ recipient.
                Non-directed donation: The donor does not name a specific tissue or organ recipient 
                </p>

<h2>Cadaver donors (Non-living)</h2>
<p>

    These are, in general, brain-dead victims or road accident victims where the patient will have a dead brain stem and cannot breathe; however, their heart and other organs can be functional with the aid of a ventilator, intravenous fluids and oxygen.
    
    
    
    Based on the death of the brain or cardiac (heart), the cadaver donors are of two types, namely:
    
    Brain deceased donor 
    Cardiac deceased donor 
    
    
    As per the Transplantation of Human Organs & Tissues Act, 37 different organs and tissues can be donated from a brain-deceased donor, whereas there are limitations for cardiac deceased donors as only a few organs, such as skin, bone, cornea and blood vessels, can be donated.
    
    
    
    The age limit for organ donation in India is based on the donor type, as the cadaver or deceased donor can donate organs without any age barrier, whereas the living donor (near relative or other) needs to have more than 18 years of age. However, in young children (< 18 years), the consent of their parents is mandatory for organ donation. </p>
